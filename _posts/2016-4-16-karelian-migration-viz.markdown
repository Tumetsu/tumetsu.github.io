Based on data produced by [Kaira](/kaira-extractor/) below is a really simple heatmap visualization of **migration rates to locations** in every year 1912-1966 as was catalogued in *Siirtokarjalaisten tie* books series. When winter war broke in 1939, there was a huge migration to Finland. After winter war a similar migration is seen back to Karelia. When Continuation War began, final migration wave is seen back to Finland.

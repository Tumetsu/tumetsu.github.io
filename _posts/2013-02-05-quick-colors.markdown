Quickcolors is a very simple Flashgame I made in few hours one evening when I was really bored. In the game you have to click colored blocks to make asked color. For example if you are asked to make orange, you have to click red and yellow blocks. Oh, and of course those blocks are moving with high speed. Game also contains some obnoxious sound effects so be prepared! Because of some feedback I have been thinking revising the color mixing concept in future possibly for a mobile game. It is still completely open topic though.

[You can play game on Kongregate](http://www.kongregate.com/games/Tumetsu/quick-colors)

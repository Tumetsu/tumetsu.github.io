Bodiless is a clever platformer where the main character has no body. Only hands, feet and head. Player can use these to move on the ledges, and advance with ways otherwise impossible. [Bodiless was also featured on Indiegames.com by John Polson](http://indiegames.com/2013/02/why_didnt_rayman_think_of_this.html)

The original concept is from 2006 and took a few iterations until I managed to finish it properly. Even now it went through some mishaps but ultimately was good enough to warrant a release.

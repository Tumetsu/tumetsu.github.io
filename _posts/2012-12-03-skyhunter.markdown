Skyhunter is my first completed Flash game made with Chevyray’s Flashpunk library, made originally in 2011. It was mostly a exercise project, so do not expect anything too fancy! However, it should be worth of couple of plays and sure teached me a lot about Flash and Actionscript

Fly with Perche Le Pascal through the skies and shoot down everything which comes by, at the same time avoiding everything which could break your balloons.

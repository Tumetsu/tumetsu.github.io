I am a young software developer born in 1991. My journey to software development began in 2005 when I decided that I'd like to make my own computer games. After dabbling with [Zelda Classic](http://www.zeldaclassic.com/) I soon found [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) which taught me the basics of programming and acted as my primary tool for development. You can find my oldest public finished game in this blog, [The North, Pohjola](/the-north-pohjola/) from 2007.

On 2010 I began university studies in *Tampere University of Technology*. Basic courses taught me about object-oriented programming and I soon migrated from GameMaker to make Flash-games with Flashpunk framework. From this era my most significant releases are [The Scorpion Box](/the-scorpion-box/) and in lesser extent [Bodiless](/bodiless/). I have also participated into Global Game Jam multiple times.

Despite of years of hobby game development I don't really see myself to be a part of game industry. Due to this in recent years I have gravitated more towards software development and worked mostly on web development. Most of the tasks have been in backend with a dash of frontend with Angular.js. You should probably read more about my work history from my [Linkedin](https://fi.linkedin.com/in/salmituomas) if you are interested.

For now I'm still studying for my masters degree and dabbling with numerous web-technologies.

This blog will act as a dumping site of my various projects from illustrations to programming tutorials. I hope you will find something valuable here for your own journey on related fields :)

Part of the reason has been the lack of\ngood tools for the task. Most distributed diary software are subscription based and store the data in a proprietary\nor otherwise difficult file format. </p>\n<p>These problems led me to few requirements for my diary needs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Text editor should be powerful and easy to use.</li>\n<li>The content should be saved in plain text format so that I can be sure it is readable in far future.</li>\n<li>The content should be secured by encryption.</li>\n<li>The tool should be free and not depend on a specific service.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Vimwiki</h2>\n<p>Sometime ago I found about <em><a href=\"https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki\">VimWiki</a></em> which is a Vim plugin for personal wiki and diary. The plugin adds shortcuts to\ncreate and organize files to a wikilike structure with interconnected wikiarticles and easy link and page generation.\nYou can read introduction to the Vimwiki from these great blog posts: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smoothterminal.com/articles/vimwiki\">Vimwiki</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.mague.com/?p=602\">Getting started with VimWiki</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I prefer using <em>Vim</em> for most of my everyday text editing tasks so <em>Vimwiki</em> obviously solved the number 1. of my\nrequirements. The plugin also fills the second requirement since the whole wiki is just a directory of plain text files.\nThe plugin and <em>Vim</em> itself are also free and open source tools so the requirement 4 is no problem either.</p>\n<p>The remaining issues are the encryption and the sharing of the wiki between my multiple PCs. My immediate thought\nwas to share the wiki via Dropbox. However, first I had to figure out how to encrypt the wiki before uploading it to the cloud service like Dropbox. </p>\n<h2>Cryptomator</h2>\n<p>I evaluated some file based encryption options. I wanted something which could encrypt individual files so that\nDropbox could sync them efficiently.\nThere are well known Unix tools suchs as <em><a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EncFS\">EncFs</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ECryptfs\">EcryptFs</a></em> for this kind of tasks.\nAfter a brief evaluation it seemed like <em>EncFs</em> is not actively developed and has some invulnerabilities and\n<em>EcryptFs</em> seemed a bit difficult to use and is not really cross-platform.</p>\n<p>The best option I could find so far was the open source application <em><a href=\"https://cryptomator.org\">Cryptomator</a></em>\nwhich is designed for encrypting files for cloud services like Dropbox.\nCryptomator supports Windows, Linux, MacOS and in some degree mobile platforms so it seemed ideal for my purposes.</p>\n<h2>Setup Vimwiki with Cryptomator</h2>\n<p>First you obviously need to install Vim, Vimwiki and Cryptomator. This guide also\nassumes you are using Unix based platform, be it Linux, MacOS or something else.</p>\n<h3>.vimrc</h3>\n<p>By default Vim creates <em>.swp</em> files to the same directory where the edited file is located. Normally this is fine\nbut if these files are saved to the Vimwiki directory, they are synced to the cloud and will then cause trouble when\nyou edit the file with another PC.</p>\n<p>I decided to add the following line to my .vimrc to save the swap-files to a single location:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&quot; Aggregate all vim swap files to a one place\nset directory^=$HOME/.vim/swapfiles//</code></pre></div>\n<p>Make sure this does not cause any problems with your specific environment.\nMake also sure to first create the <em>swapfiles</em> directory to your <em>.vim/</em> directory!</p>\n<h3>Cryptomator setup</h3>\n<p>First you should create a new Cryptomator vault which is located inside your\ncloud synced directory. The instructions to the vault creation can be found from the\n<a href=\"https://community.cryptomator.org/t/english-desktop-user-manual/30\">Cryptomator’s user guide</a></p>\n<p>After creating the new vault, unlock and open it in your file manager.\nTake note of the file path of the vault. For example in my case it is <em>/home/tuomas/.Cryptomator/wiki2vKBC3-TQebG/</em>.</p>\n<p>By default <em>Vimwiki</em> creates <em>vimwiki</em> directory to your home directory and <em>vimwiki</em>html_ for HTML-version of your wiki.\nThese directories have to be moved to our secured Cryptomator vault, so first move them to the path you noted before. </p>\n<p>Then create symlinks from your home directory to your vault:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ln -s /path/to/your/vault/vimwiki ~/vimwiki\nln -s /path/to/your/vault/vimwiki_html ~/vimwiki_html</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now your wiki files are actually located in the encrypted vault in your cloud synced directory. Before accessing the\nfiles you always have to unlock your vault. Once the vault is unlocked, you can use <em>Vimwiki</em> normally.</p>\n<h2>Final notes</h2>\n<p>So far I’m satisfied with described setup. The Cryptomator could be better and I would prefer a production ready\nCLI interface but it does its job well enough.</p>\n<p><em>Vimwiki</em> itself and its diary features seem really good in the brief time I have used them regularly.\nThe idea of a diary and a personal wiki fascinate me as powerful tools to organize my knowledge but only time\nwill tell if they actually work as I hope they will.</p>\n<p>Cover image by Jan Kahánek on Unsplash</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I have tried multiple times in my life to keep a diary or log of my life and thoughts.\nUsually this has failed by me not writing entries regularly.
